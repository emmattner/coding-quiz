# Coding Quiz

## Description
This coding quiz was created to test your knowledge on JavaScript. 

It inludes a start button to start timer and render questions, after each question being answered and submitted it will present you with your next question. The timer will come to a stop once you finish the sequence of questions.

## What did I Learn
I further expanded my understanding of classList adds and removes. I learnt how to display questions on an application and have them run through sequentially as well as how to add .toFixed(2) to display my timer. 

## Challenges I Faced

I faced a lot of challenges this week with writing this code from scratch such as putting event listeners on the right line of code. I also tried to work on creating a leaderboard to use local storage and store both scores and intials but I ran out of time to get that done although I was able to put an input box in it does not yet return your initials. I will be working on this in my spare time.
