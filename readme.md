## Coding Quiz
This coding quiz was created to test your knowledge on JavaScript. 

It inludes a start button to start timer and render questions, after each question being answered it will present you with your next question. The timer will come to a stop once you finish the sequence of questions.

## Challenges i faced

I faced a lot of challenges this week with writing this code from scratch such as putting event listeners on the right line of code. I also tried to work on creating a leaderboard to use local storage and store both scores and intials but I ran out of time to get that done.
